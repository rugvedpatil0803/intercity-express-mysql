# IntercityExpress PART I

**The PART I Project has been done by G10**  
**_Vikas Sharma (23112042)_**  
**_Rugved Ajit Patil (23112026)_**  
**_Onkar Deepak Gangurde (23112010)_**  

**The Distribution for the PART I is as Follows:**  
_ER Diagram was initially drawn by each member of the group and after the common discussion we concluded to the attached ER Diagram below:_  

```
_The Relational Schemas was designed by three of us on the same day when we finalised the ER Diagram_
```  

_And the creation of database was also performed by three of us individually on our personnel computers and after getting the errors we jot them down and discussed them on another group meet_  

_In our project, we have 13 tables, for them each of us selected either four or five tables to get the sample data prepared for database_  

_For PART II of the Project, We have distributed the Sets as follows:_  
_Set A: Rugved Ajit Patil (23112026)_  
_Set B: Onkar Deepak Gangurde (23112010)_  
_Set C: Vikas Sharma (23112042)_  


**For IntercityExpress Project, the ER Diagram is as follows:**


Note: This ER Diagram is made using Lucidchart and paint.

**For IntercityExpress Project, the Relational Schemas are as follows:**  

Note: Bold means Primary Key.  
     Itallic means Foreign Key.  

1.	train (**t_id**, capacity, milage)
2.	stand_by(_station_id_, _t_id_)
3.	route (**r_id**, r_name, distance, time_taken, operation_days, arrival_time, departure_time)
4.	connects (_r_id_, _start_station_, _end_station_)
5.	schedule (**s_id**,_ r_id_, _t_id_, actual_departure_time, actual_arrival_time, date, _driver_, _co_driver_)
6.	station (**station_id**, s_name)
7.	staff (**staff_id**, st_name, contact_no, address, rest_days)
8.	maintainance (**mt_id**, m_type)
9.	goes_through (_t_id_, _mt_id_, date)
10.	travel Agent (**ta_id**, ta_name, commission)
11.	ticket (**ticket_id**, date, time, price, _r_id_)
12.	booking (_ticket_id_, _ta_id_, _p_id_, discount, final_price)
13.	passenger(**p_id**, p_name, p_age)

**select * from train where tid in (select tid from schedule where r_id in (select r_id from route where r_id in (select r_id from connects where start_station in (select station_id from station where s_name in ("ajmer","goa","lonavla","mumbai ") and end_station in (select station_id from station where s_name in ("ajmer","goa","lonavla","mumbai "))))) and (milage>=5000 or tid in (select tid from goes_through where date<'2023-06-28')));**

_2. List all the routes in descending order of seats sold, including route information and distribution of seats sold (Children, Adult, Senior Citizen) in the month of October this year._

**select r.*, count(case when p.p_age between 0 and 12 then 1 end) as Children, count(case when p.p_age between 13 and 64 then 1 end) as Adult, count(case when p.p_age >= 65 then 1 end) as SeniorCitizen from passenger p, route r, booking b, ticket t where p.p_id=b.pid and b.ticket_id=t.ticket_id and t.r_id=r.r_id and t.date >= '2023-10-01' and t.date <= '2023-10-31'group by r.r_id order by count(t.ticket_id) desc;**

_3. List all agents’ information with more than 10 confirmed bookings in the month of September this year._

**select*from travel_agent g where g.ta_id=(select b.ta_id from ticket t, booking b where b.ticket_id=t.ticket_id and month(t.date) = 09 and year(t.date) = 2023 group by b.ta_id having count(b.ticket_id) > 10);**


_4. Display the details of the route most travelled by Senior Citizens._

**select r.* from route r where r.r_id IN(select t.r_id from ticket t where t.ticket_id IN(select b.ticket_id from booking b, passenger p where b.pid=p.p_id and p.p_age>=65));**

_5. Display the details of the route where a train was always on time._

**select r.* from route r, schedule s where r.r_id=s.r_id and r.departure_time=s.actual_departure_time and r.arrival_time=s.actual_arrival_time;**
